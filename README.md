# Apache Kafka

## WHAT IS APACHE KAFKA?
Kafka is a messaging broker system. Instead of communicating with each other, services communicate with Kafka asynchronously.
We can use it when we need to access data instantly, for example; recommendation engine, recorder, real-time stream processing, etc.
